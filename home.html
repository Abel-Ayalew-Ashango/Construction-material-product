        <p>Building material is material used for construction. Many naturally occurring substances, such as clay, rocks, sand, and wood, 
            even twigs and leaves, have been used to construct buildings. Apart from naturally occurring materials, many man-made 
            products are in use, some more and some less synthetic. The manufacturing of building materials is an established industry in 
            many countries and the use of these materials is typically segmented into specific specialty trades, such as carpentry, insulation, 
            plumbing, and roofing work. They provide the make-up of habitats and structures including homes.

            Our specialists use technical and strategic knowledge to bring mineral processing experience to your construction products 
            industry projects.
